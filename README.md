# Notes for Assumptions
- We are using `listing_date` from deals table as a date to filter the listings.
- We are using `revenue` from deals table as a revenue.
- By default we are showing results from `startDate='2020-11-01'` to `endDate='2021-11-30'`, which are mentioned in the routes > index.js file on top. So to try with different dates you can simply change these variables.
